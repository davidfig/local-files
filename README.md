# local-files
An easy to use local file server that makes designated directories available for use with your webapps. Use in combination with a development server to create local apps that easily access your file system.

## Motivation
I used to use Electron to create local graphics and (game) level editors. I realized that I didn't need much of what Electron provided. Mostly I needed to load and save files in local directories. I realized that a simple file server running in node could accomplish that.

## Installation
`yarn add local-files`

## Basic Usage
See sample directory for a simple file listing and content loading. This is still a work in progress. I'll hopefully get around to providing more details with API documentation.
